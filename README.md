A repository for MLIS INFO6540 
My name is Carlye and I am a part-time MLIS student. My background is in languages and writtent translation (es-en). As a freelance translator I typically translate clinical trial protocols. I am interested in information management, especially within a healthcare setting. I work full time at a local not-for-profit dedicated to supported unpaid, family and friend caregivers.
